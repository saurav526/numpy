Broadcasting (automatic)
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = 10
print("Broadcasting result:", x + y)


Explanation: Automatically expands smaller array values to match larger array shape.

6️⃣ broadcast_to() – Manual broadcasting
d = np.array([5, 6])
print("broadcast_to():\n", np.broadcast_to(d, (3, 2)))


Explanation: Explicitly broadcasts an array to a new shape.

🔹 Vectorization Functions (with Code + One-Line Explanation)
7️⃣ Vectorized Operation
e = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Vectorized square:", e * e)


Explanation: Performs operations on entire arrays without loops.

8️⃣ vectorize() – Convert function to vectorized form
